# What is EandoX?

EandoX is a data management platform and toolkit. It allows you to accurately track your environmental data to gain deeper insights on your full supply chain. It leverages your and your suppliers data to create up-to-date LCAs (Life Cycle Assessment)s, EPD's, and various other forms of environmental reporting to comply with CBAM and CSRD.

By analyzing the life cycle of the products and processes, you can identify areas for improvement and implement more sustainable practices.
