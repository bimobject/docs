If your manufacturing process involves ordering components from a supplier connected to EandoX, you can import their supplier product data to your library.

This has multiple benefits:

- You will get accurate LCA's without needing to request sensitive data from suppliers about their manufacturing processes.
- The manufacturing data for your supplier products will always be accurate and up to date.
- Whenever your suppliers change their manufacturing process, the data will be automatically reflected in your products. This eliminates the need for manual updates or frequent follow-ups.

If a supplier is not connected to EandoX, you can invite them and request the supplier products you need.
