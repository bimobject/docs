# Creating a product

This page is an in-depth documentation of how to create and manage a product in EandoX. It will cover all the features of the product creation process, from the basics to the advanced features.

:::tip New to EandoX?
If youâ€™re new to EandoX and just want to get started quickly (without diving into the advanced features), you can read the [product creation quickstart](/documentation/guides/creating-your-first-product) guide.

## Products vs components

In EandoX you have two different types of products: products and components.

The main difference between the two is that a component is intended for internal use only within your company, meaning it cannot have individual reporting, such as an EPD, on its own.

If you have a product that is used exclusively as a sub-assembly in other products (e.g. a **seat** used in multiple **chairs**, but never not sold separately), you can create it as a component.

:::tip Read more
The component creation process is nearly identical to the product creation process, but some details differ.

Read more about the specifics of components [here](/documentation/component/component-overview).

## Creating a new product

Navigate to the `Products` page in the left navigation menu, and click the `Create product` button in the top right corner.

![Image of the products page with the create product button](/images/product/create-product-button.jpg)

This will open a sidepanel where you can fill out the necessary information about your product. This information can be changed later on, but it is recommended to fill it out correctly the first time.

![Image of the product creation sidepanel](/images/product/create-new-product-modal.jpg)

The fields in the sidepanel are as follows:

| Field name          | Field description                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product name**    | The name of the product.                                      |
| **Article number**  | This is used to identify the product, so it should be unique. |
| **Functional Unit** | The unit in which the product is sold.                        |
| **Description**     | A description of the product.                                 |

Click `Accept` to create the product. This will take you to the product page where you can see and edit the details of your product, and start attaching other entities to it.

## Editing a product

If you want to edit an existing product, you can navigate to the `Products` page in the left navigation menu and click the product you want to edit. From there you can follow all the steps below.

![Image of the product overview page](/images/product/overview.jpg)

## The product page

On the product page, you will see multiple sections:

- **Header**: Includes the following buttons:
  - `Edit`: A dropdown menu with options to:
    - Edit the product information
    - See all comments
    - Edit [custom fields](/documentation/settings/custom-fields)
    - Share the product
    - Copy the product
    - Unpublish the product
    - Delete the product
  - `Save`: Will [save](#saving-and-publishing-products) the product, without publishing it.
  - `Publish`: Will [publish](#saving-and-publishing-products) the product.
  - `Update`: Will [update](#saving-and-publishing-products) the product.
  - `Fulfill product requests`: Read more about product requests [here](/documentation/getting-started/supplier-quickstart#responding-to-a-customer-request).
  - The `Total Weight` of the product.
- **Product details**: Shows the product information, along with the current product version and the quality of the entered data.
- **Impact**: Shows the environmental impact of the product. Requires data to be entered. Read more about [Impact graphs here](/documentation/data/impact-graphs).
<!--- **Product categorisation with AI**: Will automatically categorise the product once enough data is enetered.-->
- **Components**, **Materials**, **Packaging** and **Factories**: Shows the entities attached to the product, and allows you to add, edit and delete them.

## Managing components

In the `Components` section, click the `Add component` button.

![Image of the component section](/images/product/component-section.jpg)

This will open a sidepanel where you can search for all components and products that are available in your catalog and library.

<!--@include: ../../documentation/__partials/library-vs-catalog.md -->

![Image of the components modal](/images/product/select-components.jpg)

:::warning Nothing in the list?
If this list is empty, you need to [create a component](/documentation/component/creating-a-component), [add supplier products to your library](/documentation/library/accessing-supplier-products), or [request a component from a supplier](/documentation/library/requesting-a-supplier-product) first.

![Image of the component sidepanel](/images/product/component-sidepanel.jpg)

:::warning Editing the right data
The side panel only lets you edit the component data for the product you're working on. To edit the component itself, click its name in the "Components" table or go to the [`Components` page](/documentation/component/component-overview).
:::

On the left edge of the sidepanel you can find three tabs:

#### 1. Entity data

Shows all data for the component. Some of the fields will be editable.

All fields that start with `*` are using generic data. Adding the correct data here will improve the data quality of the product.

In this tab you can also find a graph with the environmental impact of the component.

#### 2. Transport data

Shows all transport data for the component. Here you can either use generic data, or edit the transport data to improve your data quality.

In this tab you can also find a graph with the environmental impact of the transport.

#### 3. Comments

Shows all [comments](/documentation/data/comments) for the component. These comments are only tied to the component in the product. They will not show up in the comments on the `Components` page.

:::tip
A common workflow is to request a component from a supplier and create a placeholder component yourself in the meantime.

Once the supplier responds, you can delete the placeholder and replace it with the supplier's component.

:::warning Editing the right data
The side panel only lets you edit the factory data for the product you're working on. To edit the factory itself, click its name in the "Factories" table or go to the [`Factories` page](/documentation/factory/creating-a-factory).
:::

On the left edge of the sidepanel you can find two tabs:

#### 1. Entity data

Shows all data for the factory. Some of the fields will be editable.

This tab also shows a graph with the environmental impact of the factory.

#### 2. Comments

Shows all comments for the factory.

## Relations

In the `Relations` section, you can see all components and products where this product is used.

![Image of the relations section](/images/product/relations.jpg)

This section is only presentational, and can not be interacted with. It's there for you to see how your product relate to the rest of the products in your catalog.

Visualizing these relationships helps you understand how changes to one product impact others. It can also guide you toward products that might need further review or updates after your changes are applied.

## Custom fields

Custom fields are fields that are not part of the LCA itself, but are used to store additional information about the product. This could be the CPC code, external supplier details, or who is in charge of maintaining the product.

To see the custom fields for a product, click the `Edit` dropdown in the header of the product page, and select `Edit custom fields`. This will open a sidepanel where you can add and edit data in the custom fields.

If you don't see any custom fields in the sidepanel, you can add them on the `Settings` page.

## Saving and publishing products

<!--@include: ../__partials/saving-and-publishing.md -->

:::info Component deviation
Products and components are very similar in their creation process. Therefore this guide is used for both entities.

Components are however only internal, and can therefore not be published.
