# Inviting a supplier

If you can't find the supplier you're looking for in the **Global Library**, you can invite them to join EandoX. Once they accept the invitation, they can create and share their product data with you.

## Inviting a supplier

Navigate to the `My Library` page in the left navigation menu and click on the `Suppliers` tab. Click the `Add supplier` button at the top of the page. This will open a sidepanel where you can search for suppliers.

The form contains the following fields:

| Field name              | Field description                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Company name**        | The name of the supplier.                                                                 |
| **Contact email**       | The email address of your contact for the supplier.                                       |
| **Organization number** | The organization number of the supplier.                                                  |
| **Message**             | A message to send to the supplier along with the invitation and information about EandoX. |

Click `Send invite` to send the invitation to the supplier.

### Suppliers in the system

As you type in the **Company name** field, EandoX searches for matching suppliers. If a match is found and selected, the `Invite supplier` button changes to `Add supplier`, letting you subscribe directly instead of sending an invitation.

Suppliers in the database can have one of two statuses: `Registered` or `Not registered`:

- Suppliers with `Registered` status already have EandoX accounts.
- Suppliers marked as `Not registered` are known through imported EPDs but haven't joined EandoX yet. Adding their email address when subscribing will automatically send them an invitation as well.

:::tip
Misspelling happens more often than you think. Make sure to check your spelling before sending an invitation to the supplier.

## Managing invites

After sending an invite, you can manage it through the supplier's sidepanel. To access this, find the supplier in your suppliers list and click on their name to open the sidepanel.

### Cancelling an invite

If you need to cancel an invitation that hasn't been accepted yet, you can do so from the supplier's sidepanel. Look for the `Cancel invite` button in the top right corner of the panel.

### Nudging non-responsive suppliers

If a supplier hasn't responded to your invitation for a while, you can send them a reminder. In the supplier's sidepanel, look for the `Nudge supplier` button. This will send a gentle reminder email to the supplier about your pending invitation.

:::tip When to nudge
It's recommended to wait at least a week before sending a reminder. The supplier's status will show as `Not responded` after two weeks of sending the initial invite.

## What happens next?

The supplier will receive an email with your invitation and information about EandoX. They can accept or decline the invitation. When they accept the invitation, they will automatically be added to your library with a `Signed up` status.

You can track the status of your invitation in the `Suppliers` tab. Read more about supplier statuses in the [Managing suppliers](/documentation/library/managing-suppliers#supplier-status) documentation.
