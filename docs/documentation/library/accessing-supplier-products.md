# Accessing supplier products

Before using a _supplier product_ in your own products, you'll need to import the _supplier product_ to your library first. This extra step creates a personalized collection of frequently used components, making them easier to find without searching through EandoX's extensive catalog.

Your library works across all your suppliers, so you can organize and access components from different sources in one place.

## Add supplier products to your library

Supplier products can be added to your library in two ways:

- Through the `Global library` page. This is useful if you're not subscribed to any suppliers yet, or browsing around for options.
- Through a `Supplier` sidepanel on the `My Library` page. This is useful if you're already subscribed to a supplier and want to add more of their products.

### From the Global library

Navigate to the `Global library` page in the left navigation menu. This will show you a list of all publicly available products in EandoX.

Each column has a search field at the top to help you find specific supplier products.

To add a supplier product to your library, hover the item in the list. A checkbox will appear next to the product name. Check the checkbox, then click the `+ Add products to library` button in the top right corner of the page:

Multiple products can be added at the same time.

:::warning No checkbox?
If you can't find a checkbox next to a product name, it means that the product has already been added to your library.

### From the Supplier sidepanel

Navigate to the `My library` page in the left navigation menu. Then click the `Suppliers` tab. This will show you a list of all the suppliers you are subscribed to.

At the bottom if the sidepanel you will find a section that lists all available supplier products. It shows the same fields as the `Global library` list ([see above](#supplier-product-table)), plus an **In library** column indicating which products you've already added.

To add a supplier product to your library, check the checkbox next to its name. Then click the `+ Add products to library` button.

### What happens next?

After adding a supplier product to your library, you'll see it on the `My Library` page. You'll also automatically be subscribed to the supplier and receive notifications about any changes to the product's manufacturing or supply chain.

## Inspecting a supplier product before adding it to your library

Clicking the name of a supplier product will open a sidepanel that shows more detailed information about the product, its environmental impact, and material content.

![Supplier product sidepanel](/images/library/supplier-product-sidepanel.jpg)

If the supplier product is already in your library, it will have the text `(in library)` after its name in the sidepanel header.

If the supplier product is not yet in your library, you can add it by clicking the `Add to library` button in the top right corner of the sidepanel.
