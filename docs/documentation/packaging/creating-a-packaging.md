# Creating a packaging

This article will go through all the steps of creating a packaging entity in EandoX.

## Creating a new packaging

Navigate to the `Packaging` page in the left navigation menu, and click the `Create packaging` button in the top right corner.

This will open a sidepanel where you can fill out the necessary information about your packaging. This information can be changed later on, but it is recommended to fill it out correctly the first time.

The fields in the sidepanel are as follows:

| Field name          | Field description                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Packaging name**  | The name of the packaging.                                      |
| **Article number**  | This is used to identify the packaging, so it should be unique. |
| **Functional unit** | The unit in which the packaging is used.                        |

Click `Confirm` to create the packaging. This will take you to the packaging page where you can view and edit the the details of your packaging, and start attaching other entities to it.
